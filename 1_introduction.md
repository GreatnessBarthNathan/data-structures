# What is a Data Structure?

A data structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently

More elaborately, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to that data

## Why Learn Data Structures?

Almost every application we build involves data that is modelled in a certain way

To efficiently manage that data, you need data structures

Imagine walking into a library only to find out there is no efficient organization of the books and they are stored radomly. It will take you hours to find a book and you might never walk into that library again

The difference between a function taking a few milliseconds and one taking a few seconds or even minutes to execute, comes down to the selection of the right data structure

Data structures help you solve problems in a more efficient way, both in terms of time and memory

Learning about data structures also help you gain a more profound understanding of things you're already aware of

For Example:

The Document Object Model (DOM) - is a Tree data structure

The Browser back and forward - is a Stack data structure

OS job scheduling - is a Queue data structure

Data structures are everywhere and having knowledge of them can only help you in every step of your coding journey

## Course Overview

Built in data structures

- Arrays
- Objects
- Sets
- Maps

We will then use the built in data structures to create Custom data structures

Custom Data Structures

- Stacks
- Queues
- Circular queues
- Linked lists
- Hash tables
- Trees
- Graphs
