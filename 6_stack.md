# Stack

The stack data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO)

This means the last element inserted into the stack is the first element to be removed

A common analogy is a stack of plates. The last plate placed on top of the stack is also the first plate removed from the stack

Stack is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model

So a stack is simply a list, and what makes it a stack is how it behaves

The Stack data structure supports two main operations:

- Push, which adds an element to the collection
- Pop, which removes the most recently added element from the collection

## Stack Usage

Typically, a stack is great when you have to trace back your steps. For Example:

- Browser history tracking (the go back and go forward buttons in a browser make use of the stack operation)
- Undo operations when typing
- Expression conversions
- Call stack in JavaScript runtime
